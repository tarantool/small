	*** test_reserve ***
    ok 1 - init
    ok 2 - reserve does not occupy memory
    ok 3 - reserve creates slabs
    ok 4 - alloc returns the same as reserve, even if size is less
    ok 5 - alloc updated 'used'
    ok 6 - next reserve didn't touch 'used'
    ok 7 - but changed 'total' because second slab is allocated
    ok 8 - slab count is 2 now
    ok 9 - gc works fine with empty reserved slabs
    ok 10 - all slabs are removed

    ok 5 - second 16 aligned alloc of 1 byte is far from first
    ok 6 - aligned by 16 too
    ok 7 - 'used'
    ok 8 - align next by 4 bytes, should be closer to previous
    ok 9 - aligned by 4
    ok 10 - 'used'
    ok 11 - 32 byte aligned alloc of slab size
    ok 12 - gc deleted all
