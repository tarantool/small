/**
 * Pool allocator.
 *
 * Good for allocating tons of small objects of the same size.
 * Stores all objects in order-of-virtual-page-size memory blocks,
 * called slabs. Each object can be freed if necessary. There is
 * (practically) no allocation overhead. Internal fragmentation
 * may occur if lots of objects are allocated, and then many of
 * them are freed in reverse-to-allocation order.
 *
 * Under the hood, uses a slab cache of mmap()-allocated slabs.
 * Slabs of the slab cache are never released back to the
 * operating system.
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * -------------
 * Calls to alloc() and free() on the same mempool instance must
 * be externally synchronized. Use of different instances in
 * different threads is thread-safe (but they must also be based
 * on distinct slab caches).
 *
 * Exception-safety
 * ----------------
 * The only type of failure which can occur is a failure to
 * allocate memory. In case of such error, an exception
 * (OutOfMemory) is raised. ()
 * version of mempool_alloc() returns NULL rather than raises an
 * error in case of failure.
