/**
 * Quota lessor is a convenience wrapper around thread-safe `struct quota`
 * to allocate small chunks of memory from the single thread. Original quota
 * has 1Kb precision and uses atomics, which are too slow for frequent calls
 * from different threads.
 *
 * The quota lessor allocates huge (1Mb+) chunks of memory from
 * the source quota and then leases small chunks to the end users.
 * The end of lease is implemented in the similar way - the lessor
 * does not release small amounts, but accumulates freed memory until
 * it reaches at least 1Mb an then releases it.
 *
 * This decreases usage of atomic locks and improves quota
 * precision from 1024 bytes to 1 byte. This class, however, is
 * not thread-safe, so there must be a lessor in each thread.
