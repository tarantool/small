/* {{{ Description */
/*
 * matras - Memory Address TRanSlation Allocator (Smile)
 * matras is as allocator, that provides aligned blocks of specified
 * size (N), and a 32-bit integer identifiers for
 * each returned block. Block identifiers grow incrementally
 * starting from 0.
 *
 * The block size (N) must be a power of 2 (checked by assert in
 * the debug build). matras can restore a pointer to the block
 * give block ID, so one can store such 32-bit ids instead of
 * storing pointers to blocks.
 *
 * Since block IDs grow incrementally from 0 and matras
 * instance stores the number of provided blocks, there is a
 * simple way to iterate over all provided blocks.
 *
 * Implementation
 * --------------
 * To support block allocation, matras allocates extents of memory
 * by means of the supplied allocator, each extent having the same
 * size (M), M is a power of 2 and a multiple of N.
 * There is no way to free a single block, except the last one,
 * allocated, which happens to be the one with the largest ID.
 * Destroying a matras instance frees all allocated extents.
 *
 * Address translation
 * -------------------
 * To implement 32-bit address space for block identifiers,
 * matras maintains a simple tree of address translation tables.
 *
 * * First N1 bits of the identifier denote a level 0 extend
 *   id, which stores the address of level 1 extent.
 *
 * * Second N2 bits of block identifier stores the address
 *   of a level 2 extent, which stores actual blocks.
 *
 * * The remaining N3 bits denote the block number
 *   within the extent.
 *
 * Actual values of N1 and N2 are a function of block size B,
 * extent size M and sizeof(void *).
 *
 * To sum up, with a given N and M matras instance:
 *
 * 1) can provide not more than
 *    pow(M / sizeof(void*), 2) * (M / N) blocks
 *
 * 2) costs 2 random memory accesses to provide a new block
 *    or restore a block pointer from block id
 *
 * 3) has an approximate memory overhead of size (L * M)
 *
 * Of course, the integer type used for block id (matras_id_t,
 * usually is a typedef to uint32) also limits the maximum number
 * of objects that can be allocated by a single instance of matras.
 *
 * Versioning
 * ----------
 * Starting from Tarantool 1.6, matras implements a way to create
 * a consistent read view of allocated data with
 * matras_create_read_view(). Once a read view is
 * created, the same block identifier can return two different
 * physical addresses in two views: the created view
 * and the current or latest view. Multiple read views can be
 * created.  To work correctly with possibly existing read views,
 * the application must inform matras that data in a block is about to
 * change, using matras_touch() call. Only a block which belong to
 * the current, i.e. latest, view, can be changed: created
 * views are immutable.
 *
 * The implementation of read views is based on copy-on-write
 * technique, which is cheap enough as long as not too many
 * objects have to be touched while a view exists.
 * Another important property of the copy-on-write mechanism is
 * that whenever a write occurs, the writer pays the penalty
 * and copies the block to a new location, and gets a new physical
 * address for the same block id. The reader keeps using the
 * old address. This makes it possible to access the
 * created read view in a concurrent thread, as long as this
 * thread is created after the read view itself is created.

 * "Shifts and masks explanation"
 * For 3-level matras (L = 3), as claimed above, block ID consist of
 * three parts (N1, N2 and N3).
 * In order to optimize splitting ID, several masks and shifts
 * are precalculated during matras initialization.
 * Heres is an example block ID bits, high order bits first:
 * ID :   0  0  0  0  N1 N1 N1 N1 N2 N2 N2 N2 N3 N3 N3 N3 N3
 * mask1: 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
 * mask1: 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1
 *                                <---------shift1-------->
 *                                            <---shift2-->
 * When defined in such way, one can simply split ID to N1, N2 and N3:
 * N1 = ID >> shift1
 * N2 = (ID & mask1) >> shift2
 * N3 = ID & mask2
